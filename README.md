Welcome to the Descope JavaScript repository.
The Descope JS repository is composed of npm packages, sdks and widgets.

## 🖥️ Client SDKs

Descope Client SDKs are used to create and manage authentication flows, management widgets, and session management. They are especially useful when integrating Descope into your client application.

## :cherry_blossom: Widgets

[Descope Widgets](https://github.com/descope/descope-js/tree/main/packages/widgets) are embeddable components designed to facilitate the delegation of operations to your application's users. These widgets can be utilized in both B2B and B2C contexts, allowing your users to perform various tenant, user management, and project level operations from within the application itself.  
[Read More](https://docs.descope.com/customize/widgets) about Descope's widgets.
